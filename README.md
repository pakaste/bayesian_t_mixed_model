# Bayesian t-mixed modeling for familial data

This repository contains Python implementation of *Mixed effects linear models with t-distributions for quantitative genetic analysis: a Bayesian approach*, by Strand√©n & Gianola.

Current implementation only supports continuous priors for variance parameters, even though uniform priors could be used as well.

## Requirements

All the libraries needed to run this repo are in requirements. Inside a virtual environment requirements can be installed with following command:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
